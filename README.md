## Assignment

This is the first environment setup task in the course. In this assignment, we will set up GitHub Classroom for all future programming assignments.


### Installing Git

Version control with Git will be a large aspect of this course. You will be managing and submitting your programming assignments using Git. Since assignments are completed in the Unix environment, you will be able to access Git directly from the Mac terminal or the Linux shell.

Please follow these instructions for installing Git:

1.  Make sure you have Git installed. Instructions on installing Git for your particular OS (Mac or Linux) can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2.  To improve your Git experience, you will need to set up SSH keys for the machine using Git, if you haven't done so. To set up SSH keys, please refer to this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Note that you only need to complete the subsection titled _Generating a new SSH key_ for your OS.
3.  Add your newly-generated SSH keys to the GitHub account, as done [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).


### Creating a GitHub Account

If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create an account in [GitHub](http://www.github.com/). Remember to submit all future assignments using this GitHub username.


### Setting Up GitHub Classroom

Throughout the semester, we will be using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) for programming assignment submissions. Please follow these steps to set up GitHub Classroom:
* Visit [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), and sign in and authorize your GitHub account for GitHub classroom. Note that you will need to complete this step only once. 
* For each assignment, you will receive a GitHub Classroom invitation through Gradescope/Courseworks.
* Log in to GitHub, and accept the invitation. Once you accept the invitation, the repository will be created for you. Click on the repository link on the confirmation page, and accept the second invitation that appears.
* You will also receive an e-mail from GitHub confirming the creation of your assignment repository, along with an invitation to modify that repository.

## Submission
Please add your Columbia UNI and GitHub username in the [uni.txt](uni.txt) file we have created, and make sure to commit and push this file in your final submission.

## Piazza

If you have any questions about this programming assignment, please post them in the [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/kekhb0ii3uh23z?cid=7) for the course, and an instructor will reply to them as soon as possible. Any updates to the assignment itself will be available in Piazza.
