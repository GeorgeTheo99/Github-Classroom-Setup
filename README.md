## Assignment

This is the first environment setup task. In this assignment, we will setup Github classroom for all the future programming assignments in this course. 


### Installing Git

Version control with Git will be a large aspect of this course. You will be managing and submitting your programming assignments using Git. Since assignments are completed in the Linux environment, you will be able to access Git directly from the Linux shell.

Please follow these instructions for installing Git:

1.  Make sure you have Git installed. Instructions on installing Git for Linux can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2.  To improve your Git experience, you will need to set up SSH keys for the machine using Git, if you haven't done so. To set up SSH keys, please refer to this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Note that you only need to complete the subsection titled _Generating a new SSH key_ for Linux.
3.  Add your newly-generated SSH keys to the GitHub account, as done [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).


### Creating a GitHub Account

If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create an account in [GitHub](http://www.github.com/). Remember to submit all future assignments using this GitHub username.


### Setting Up GitHub Classroom

Throughout the semester, we will be using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) for programming assignment submissions. Please follow these steps to set up GitHub Classroom:
* Go to [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), signin and authorize your GitHub account for GitHub classroom. (Note: You have to do this step just once. This step is for authorizing your GitHub account for using Github classroom application.) 
* For each assignment, you will receive a GitHub classroom invitation through Gradescope/Courseworks.
* Log in to GitHub, and accept the invitation. Once you accept the invitation, the repository will be created for you. Click on the repository link on the confirmation page and accept invitation.
* You will also receive an e-mail from GitHub confirming the creation of your assignment repository wiht an invitation to modify that repository. 

## Submission
Please add your Columbia UNI and GitHub username in the [uni.txt](uni.txt) file we have created, and make sure to commit and push this file in your final submission.

## Piazza

If you have any questions about this programming assignment, please post them in the [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/kekhb0ii3uh23z?cid=7) for the course, and an instructor will reply to them as soon as possible. Any updates to the assignment itself will be available in Piazza.
